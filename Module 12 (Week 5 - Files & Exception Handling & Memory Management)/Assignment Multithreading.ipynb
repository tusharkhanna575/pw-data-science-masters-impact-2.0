    "**Advantages of Multithreading:**\n",
    "1. `Improved Performance`: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, which can improve the performance of the application by utilizing the  available CPU resources more efficiently.\n",
    "2. `Responsiveness`: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of the application by allowing tasks to be executed in parallel, which can reduce the overall execution time.\n",
    "3. `Resource Sharing`: Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory, files, and other system resources, which can reduce the overhead of creating and managing separate processes.\n",
    "4. `Simplicity`: Multithreading can simplify the design of complex applications by allowing different tasks to be executed concurrently in separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Multithreading:**\n",
    "1. `Complexity`: Multithreading can introduce complexity into the application design, as developers need to manage synchronization, communication, and coordination between threads.\n",
    "2. `Synchronization`: Multithreading can introduce synchronization issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks, which can be difficult to debug and resolve \n",
    "3. `Overhead`: Multithreading can introduce overhead due to the creation, management, and synchronization of threads, which can impact the performance of the application.\n",
    "4. `Debugging`: Multithreading can make debugging more difficult, as issues such\n",

    "\n",
    "**Deadlocks:**\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release the resources they need. A deadlock situation arises when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release the resources they need to proceed. Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads acquire locks on resources in a different order, leading to a circular wait condition. Deadlocks can be avoided by ensuring that threads acquire locks on resources in a consistent order and by using timeouts and deadlock detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race Conditions:**\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data and try to modify it at the same time. As a result, the outcome of the execution depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events. Race conditions can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, and inconsistencies in the program. They can be avoided by using synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and monitors to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time."
