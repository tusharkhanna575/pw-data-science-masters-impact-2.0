    "#### Q.1 What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of data that is stored in a computer system. Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve data. They are used in many applications, such as websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) to interact with the database. SQL databases are used in many applications, such as websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications. SQL databases are used to store data in tables, which are organized into rows and columns. SQL databases are used to store data in a structured format, which makes it easy to query and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use SQL to interact with the database. NoSQL databases are used in many applications, such as websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications. NoSQL databases are used to store data in a non-structured format, which makes it easy to store and retrieve data. NoSQL databases are used to store data in a non-structured format, which makes it easy to store and retrieve data."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. DDL is used to define the structure of the database, such as creating tables, dropping tables, altering tables, and truncating tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE is used to create a new table in the database. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table called `users` with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`.\n",

    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP is used to drop an existing table from the database. For example, the following SQL statement drops the `users` table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE users;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER is used to modify an existing table in the database. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called `age` to the `users` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE is used to remove all the data from a table without dropping the table itself. For example, the following SQL statement removes all the data from the `users` table.\n",

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. DML is used to manipulate the data in the database, such as inserting new data, updating existing data, and deleting existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT is used to insert new data into a table in the database. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into the `users` table with the values `1`, `John Doe`, and `john@ymail.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john@ymail.com');\n",
    "```\n",

    "UPDATE is used to update existing data in a table in the database. For example, the following SQL statement updates the `name` column of the row with `id` equal to `1` in the `users` table to `Jane Doe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;\n",
